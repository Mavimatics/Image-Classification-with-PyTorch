# Image Classification with PyTorch

## Project Overview

This Python-based project utilizes PyTorch to perform image classification on different species of flowers. The project is divided into two parts: 
- developing an image classifier with PyTorch in a Jupyter notebook
- building a line application

The notebook focuses on building and training a model, while the command-line application allows users to train a new network, make predictions, and customize model parameters.
